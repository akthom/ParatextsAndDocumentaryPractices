In this paper, using molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that there exists, in addition to the above-mentioned lid, a novel second lid in this lipase. We further show that the second lid, covering residues 210&#x02013;222, acts as a triggering lid for the movement of the first. We also investigate the role of hydrophobicity in the movement of the lids and show that two residues, Phe214 and Ala217, play important roles in lid movement. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a double-lid movement of the type described in our manuscript has been presented to the scientific community.

Studying lid movement is an area of active research in the field of protein dynamics. The lipase from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a 29-kDa protein that was previously crystallized in the open conformation, and as expected, an approximately 20-residue lid subdomain was identified. In the present study, the authors report extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase. They show that this protein has two lids covering the substrate-binding pocket. The first lid is the one proposed from the known crystal structure. The second lid, a much shorter one, lies over the binding pocket facing the first lid. Furthermore, using position-restrained simulations, these authors show that movement of the second lid may actually be a trigger for the movement of the first, and that this triggering action is driven by hydrophobic contacts between the two lids. This computational study paves a way for experimentalists to study the structure and dynamics of this protein in greater detail in order to understand coupled subdomain movements in a comprehensive fashion.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Cherukuvada SL, Seshasayee ASN, Raghunathan K, Anishetty S, Pennathur G (2005) Evidence of a double-lid movement in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> lipase: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations.

An interesting characteristic of lipases is their interfacial activation.

The active site residues in this lipase are Ser82, Asp229, and His251. The loop containing the active-site histidine is stabilized by an octahedrally coordinated calcium ion.

We show that the movement of lid2 acts as a trigger for the movement of lid1. Using similar MD simulations of rational in-silico mutants of this lipase, we elucidate the importance of hydrophobic interactions in movement of the lids. Thus we provide novel insights into interfacial activation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>Comparisons of the crystal structures of the open and the closed forms of lipases have been used to conclusively identify mobile loops. However, the crystal structure of only the open form of the lipase from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is available. Under these circumstances, it is imperative to use other techniques, such as MD simulations, to identify such mobile loops that are essential for the enzyme's activity. Simulations of the open and the closed form of <italic>Humicola lanuginose</italic> lipase, a fungal lipase, in water for 12 ns using a standard procedure has shown that the open form tends to move towards the closed conformation, while not closing entirely, whereas the closed form remains as such &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010028-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Ours is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive study on the dynamics of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase.</p><p>The open structure of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This was solvated in explicit water and energy minimized. The energy-minimized structure was subjected to MD simulation for 20 ns. The backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) as calculated after least square fit increased steadily up to about 2.5 ns and reached a plateau. The RMSD value started increasing again after about 4.5 ns and stabilized at around 7 ns. General simulation parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010028-sd005">Protocol S5</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>The First Lid</title><p>Since the starting structure is in the open, active conformation, and lipases are known to be activated only at lipid-water interfaces, lid1 can be expected to close in aqueous environments. When the simulated structure (represented here by the 10-ns snapshot) is superimposed on the energy-minimized starting structure, and lid1 highlighted, the movement of this lid towards a typical closed conformation becomes apparent. It can also be seen that the mobile region consists of a helix-loop-helix motif. In the crystal structure, the first helix covers residues 113&#x02013;117 while the second helix encompasses residues 126&#x02013;146. In this helix-loop-helix motif, residues 116&#x02013;138 show high RMS deviations. The C-terminal portion (139&#x02013;146) of the second helix remains largely rigid. The loop region following this motif&#x02014;residues 150&#x02013;156&#x02014;appears to be highly flexible. This lid has moved by a distance of 1.25 nm, as measured by the distance between the Ca atoms of V130 in the starting structure and in the simulated structure. The RMSD of the lid after least-square fit of the protein backbones is approximately 0.9 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Second Lid</title><p>On careful analysis we find two regions, besides lid1, that show high mobility. This includes a stretch of amino acids from residues 20 to 30 and another from 203 to 228. Of the two, the latter is found to move towards lid1, thereby augmenting the effect of the movement of lid1. While most residues in the 203&#x02013;228 region belong to loops, residues 210&#x02013;222 compose an alpha helix, whose movement towards the opposite lid is significant. When we refer to lid2, we point to the above-mentioned helical region. A spacefill model of both the starting and the simulated structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) clearly reflects the effect of the movement of the lids in reducing the solvent accessibility of the binding pocket. Quantitatively, the exposed area of the side chains forming the pocket HA decreased from 98.4 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> to 0.86 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, which is almost a 100&#x00025; decrease. This has led us to the conclusion that there is a second lid, which, together with the first lid, acts as a double door in protecting the hydrophobic binding site from the polar solvent. The structures of the lipase obtained at different time points of the simulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g002">Figure 2</xref>B.</p><p>The 10 ns structure does not differ much from the final 20-ns structure (lid1 and lid2 RMSDs are less than 0.1 nm) and hence was taken as the representative structure on the basis of which simulations involving the closed form were performed. Also, the third highly mobile region, residues 20&#x02013;30, does not cover the binding pocket and hence is not included in further discussion. This movement is touched upon in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010028-sd006">Protocol S6</xref>. Moreover, restraining the movement of this third loop does not seem to affect lid movement in any manner.</p><p>A &#x0201c;back&#x0201d; simulation was performed using the closed structure in a water-octane interface. We observed that both the lids actually opened out, and the structure thus formed was nearly the same as the initial crystal structure. The RMSD variation of the lids during the course of the simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g003">Figure 3</xref>A. The open form obtained after 20 ns and the crystal structure are superimposed to a C-alpha RMSD of 0.08 nm and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g003">Figure 3</xref>B.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Lid2 Movement Triggers Movement of Lid1</title><p>In an earlier paper, Gunasekaran and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010028-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated the effect of triggering loops in enzyme catalysis using restrained MD. To investigate the interdependence of the movements of the two lids, we have applied the same approach. For this we carried out two separate simulations, one with lid1 restrained and the other with lid2 restrained. We observe that while each lid, with the other lid restrained, moves initially, subsequent and significant movement of lid1 is seen only when lid2 is also mobile. RMSD of lid1 increased to 0.4 nm in about 2 ns in both the unrestrained and lid2-restrained systems. The second RMSD increase at about 5 ns, from 0.4 to 0.9 nm, seen in the unrestrained system, is absent in the lid2-restrained system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The extent of movement of lid2 appears to be independent of that of lid1. In both the unrestrained and the lid1-restrained systems, the RMSD of lid2 in the stable state is approximately 0.4 nm. However, the nature of the trajectory is different in the two cases. In the restrained case, lid2 moves to an RMSD of 0.4 nm within 6 ns, while this is achieved only after 8 ns in the case of the unrestrained molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, this minor difference can be attributed to the chaotic nature of MD simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Lid Closure is Driven by Hydrophobic Interactions</title><p>A helical wheel representation of the two lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g005">Figure 5</xref>) in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lipase shows that the helices involved are amphipathic, with hydrophobic side chains protruding towards the binding site and towards the opposite lid. The presence of this hydrophobic surface facing the binding site is an ideal construction that allows the binding cleft and the lids to come together through hydrophobic interactions. We hypothesize that significant movement of lid1 corresponding to the 5 ns region in the unrestrained system may require the presentation of hydrophobic residues by lid2 in near proximity to lid1, which does not happen when lid2 is restrained. In fact, close (less than 0.1 nm between contacting surfaces) contacts between Ala126, Val130, and Leu131 on lid1, and Pro210, Phe214, and Ala217 on lid2, are seen in the final stable structure obtained from the unrestrained simulation. This led us to look at the role of hydrophobic interactions in the lid movement. To get further insights into the movement of the lids, we performed further MD with rational in silico mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Role of Hydrophobic Interactions in Interfacial Activation</title><p>We performed molecular dynamics on different in silico mutants of the two residues in lid2, Ala217 and Phe214, so as to implicate the role of hydrophobicity in the movement of the lids. These residues were chosen because they make contacts with residues on lid1 in the closed conformation. Pro210, which also contacts residues on lid1 in the closed conformation, was left untouched because of the possibility of profound local impacts that a proline can impart to a structure. This Pro acts as the N-terminal cap to the lid2 helix and may also be a hinge residue. The aim of this study is to assess the importance of hydrophobic residues in the triggering lid on the movement of the major lid1, and hence only residues from lid2 were mutated.</p><p>At the first level, we carried out MD studies on single mutants: the Phe214 and Ala126 were independently mutated to Ser in two different simulations. This was done so as to investigate the role of individual residues in domain movement. These mutations do not seem to affect the lid movement, which is almost the same as in the wild type. The RMSDs of the lids are similar in both the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g006">Figure 6</xref>; for qualitative information, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010028-sd007">Protocol S7</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently we performed a double mutation, Phe214Ser/Ala217Ser. After 20 ns of simulation, the lids did not close. The RMSD plot of the simulation is highly fluctuating and there is nearly no change in the distance between the lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus the double mutation affected the lid movement to a great extent, establishing the robustness that multiple hydrophobic contacts confer to the function of a protein.</p><p>We have also looked at the importance of hydrophobicity in maintaining the closed structure. The closed form of the lipase was mutated at both residues Phe214 and Ala217 to Ser. This structure was simulated in both water and an octane-water interface. In both cases, the lids failed to open. This behaviour in water, where the wild-type lipase is expected to be in a closed form, shows that these hydrophobic contacts are essential only to drive the lid-closure process, but they do not affect the stability of the closed conformation. That the mutant is unable to open up in a water-octane interface, contrary to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010028-g008">Figure 8</xref>), shows that hydrophobicity appears to be essential to lid opening and hence interfacial activation as well. Possibly there is a greater hydrophobic affinity between octane and lid2 than between the lids; thus there appears to be an intricate role for hydrophobicity in the domain movement of lipase.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title><p>We have performed restrained and unrestrained MD simulations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase in an aqueous environment. This is a lipase whose structure has not been studied as extensively as fungal lipases, leading to paucity of data. We show that this lipase has two lids covering the binding cleft in its putative closed conformation, and that the movement of each lid is not entirely independent of that of the other. We also investigated the role played by an intricate hydrophobic interaction network in the dynamics and, hence, the function of the enzyme. While MD techniques, given the highly developed nature of the force fields used, are fairly accurate, the results that we show amount to a strong hypothesis. However, our theories are amenable to experimental verification. A crystal structure of the closed form of the lipase would allow comparison of experimentally determined structures of the two conformations of the lipase and hence identify mobile loops. On the other hand, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, could be carried out to elucidate the role of hydrophobic contacts in driving lid closure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Software and infrastructure.</title><p>The simulations were carried out using GROMACS 3.2 running on single IBM 2.8 GHz systems loaded with Fedora Core 2 Linux at the BTIS facility, Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University.

Measures</title><p>Here we show the time variation of the distance between the lids and the RMSD of the two flaps as a function of time. The RMSD of lid1 (red) after least-square fit of the protein backbones is approximately 0.9 nm. The RMSD of the helix in lid2 (blue) is also shown. This is corroborated by a plot of distance between the two lids against time (black). There is an appreciable decrease in this distance after 6 ns. The lid1-lid2 distance stabilizes at about 8 ns, after which there is little relative movement between the two lids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0010028.g001"/></fig><fig id="pcbi-0010028-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Lid Movement in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Lipase: Qualitative Representation</title><p>(A) This figure represents the simulation results.

The lids do not open to expose the lid to the octane-water interface. Thus, hydrophobicity appears to be essential for the lids to open. Hydrophobic affinity between the lid and the octane may be higher than that between the lids, allowing the lids to move apart. In the absence of such hydrophobic groups in lid2, this movement does not take place.</p><p>Red, lid1 RMSD; blue, lid2 RMSD; black, lid1-lid2 distance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0010028.g008"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack2" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> ASNS and GP conceived and designed the experiments.
